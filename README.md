## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for my MSc Data Science project titled "Anomaly detection in mammography using autoencoders and CNN
". The project was conducted as part of my studies at University of Hertfordshire, during the 2023/2024 academic year. The main goal of this project is to develop and evaluate advanced machine-learning models for detecting anomalies in mammography images.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Comparing the performance of convolutional autoencoders (CAE) and variational autoencoders (VAE) against DenseNets (CNN) in identifying these anomalies to determine
2. Deterimine which model provides higher accuracy and reliability in anomaly detection.
3. Assess the computational efficiency and scalability of each model when applied to large datasets of mammography images

## Data Description

The data used in this project was sourced from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/ywsbh3ndr8/5 and contains a total of approximately 4,000 images, with the total size of 54 MB, and 227x227 pixels after data augmentation and preprocessing.


## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following tools and libraries:

- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, etc.
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook
- Version Control: Git
